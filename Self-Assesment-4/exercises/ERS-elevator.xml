    <title>Software Requirements Specification: ACME elevator FAMILY model</title>
    <text>

**1. Introduction**


1.1. Purpose: This SRS describes the detailed requirements for the FAMILY model of the ACME elevator.This document has been submitted to Configuration Control and assigned a 1.0 Version number. It is valid for all purposes: Design, system testing, and project management. 


1.2. Scope: The FAMILY model is the simplest and cheapest elevator in the product family. This elevator is designed for small family houses (hence the model’s name), which are the most typical family houses in the US. The target customer is a grown-up or handicapped person who cannot use the stairs and needs help to get to the rooms on the upper floor. This elevator complies with all applicable safety regulations and is equipped with doors, an internal light, an alarm, and an emergency phone system. The alarm and the emergency phone system are independent devices; they have particular hardware and software, and therefore they are out of the scope of the current system.

2. Overall description 


2.1. Product perspective: the FAMILY model is a regular elevator composed of: 

**Cabin with enough space for 4 regular people or a wheelchair. 

Internal (within-cabin) control panel. It contains floor buttons, an alarm, and an emergency phone.  External (wall) control panel. There are panels on the bottom and top floors. They contain call buttons. 

Internal light. **

 
2.2. User functions: The only function the user can perform is to move the elevator to the designated floor. 

 

2.3. User characteristics: FAMILY models must follow the same conventions as regular elevators to ease safety operation. In particular, buttons should be lit when pressed, and doors closed during operation.  

 
2.4. Constraints: 

2.5. Assumptions and dependencies: 

2.6. Apportioning: 

 

3. Specific requirements 


3.1. Functional requirements 


3.1.1. When an external call button is pressed, the elevator will move to the floor where the button was pressed. 


3.1.2. When an internal button is pressed, the elevator will move to the corresponding floor.

    <defect type="Consistency" weight="1" comment="The buttons have not been enumerated previously in Section 1.2. Section 2 is not required to describe the elevator’s components (Section 2.1 has this responsibility), but if it does, it shall be consistent.">Internal (within-cabin) control panel.
