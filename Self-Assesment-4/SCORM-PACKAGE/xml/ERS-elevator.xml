 1. Introduction

1.1. Purpose: 

        This SRS describes the detailed requirements for the FAMILY model of the ACME elevator. This document has been submitted to Configuration Control and assigned 1.0 Version number. It is valid for all purposes, namely: Design, system testing and project management.

1.2. Scope: 

        The FAMILY model is the simplest and cheapest elevator in the product family. This elevator is designed for small family houses (hence the model?s name), which are the most typical family houses in the US. The target customer is a grown-up or handicapped person who cannot use the stairs and needs help to get to the rooms in the upper floor. This elevator complies with all applicable safety regulations, and therefore it is equipped with doors, an internal light, an alarm and an emergency phone system. The alarm and the emergency phone system are independent devices; they have particular hardware and software and therefore they are out of the scope of the current system.

2.2. User functions: 

        The only function the user can perform is to move the elevator to the designated floor.
